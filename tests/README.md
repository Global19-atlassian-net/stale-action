# Stale-Action

This action is adapted from Probot's [Stale app](https://github.com/probot/stale), built by [@bkeepers](https://github.com/bkeepers), which itself was onspired by @parkr's [auto-reply](https://github.com/parkr/auto-reply#optional-mark-and-sweep-stale-issues) bot that runs @jekyllbot.

It uses [Actions-Toolkit](https://github.com/JasonEtco/actions-toolkit) by [@JasonEtco](https://github.com/JasonEtco) and is built to be scheduled by triggering a `repository_dispatch` HTTP event from an external service, allowing you to customize how often to scan for stale content.

## Usage

1. Create `.github/stale.yml` based on the following template.
2. Create a `main.workflow` based off the [`example.workflow`](./example.workflow) in this repository, which will start a scan in response to a `repository_dispatch` event.

A `.github/stale.yml` file is required to enable the plugin. The file can be empty, or it can override any of these default settings:

```yml
# Configuration for probot-stale - https://github.com/probot/stale

# Number of days of inactivity before an Issue or Pull Request becomes stale
daysUntilStale: 60

# Number of days of inactivity before an Issue or Pull Request with the stale label is closed.
# Set to false to disable. If disabled, issues still need to be closed manually, but will remain marked as stale.
daysUntilClose: 7

# Issues or Pull Requests with these labels will never be considered stale. Set to `[]` to disable
exemptLabels:
  - pinned
  - security
  - "[Status] Maybe Later"

# Set to true to ignore issues in a project (defaults to false)
exemptProjects: false

# Set to true to ignore issues in a milestone (defaults to false)
exemptMilestones: false

# Set to true to ignore issues with an assignee (defaults to false)
exemptAssignees: false

# Label to use when marking as stale
staleLabel: wontfix

# Comment to post when marking as stale. Set to `false` to disable
markComment: >
  This issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had
  recent activity. It will be closed if no further activity occurs. Thank you
  for your contributions.

# Comment to post when removing the stale label.
# unmarkComment: >
#   Your comment here.

# Comment to post when closing a stale Issue or Pull Request.
# closeComment: >
#   Your comment here.

# Limit the number of actions per hour, from 1-30. Default is 30
limitPerRun: 30

# Limit to only `issues` or `pulls`
# only: issues

# Optionally, specify configuration settings that are specific to just 'issues' or 'pulls':
# pulls:
#   daysUntilStale: 30
#   markComment: >
#     This pull request has been automatically marked as stale because it has not had
#     recent activity. It will be closed if no further activity occurs. Thank you
#     for your contributions.

# issues:
#   exemptLabels:
#     - confirmed
```

TheA `main.workflow` file contains multiple `on` events. The main one that triggers a scan for stale content is `on = "repository_dispatch"`. The others are events that listen for activity on issues and pull requests to unmark them if they were previously marked as stale.

```hcl
workflow "Run Stale!" {
  on = "repository_dispatch"
  resolves = ["probot/stale-action@master"]
}

action "probot/stale-action@master" {
  uses = "probot/stale-action@master"
  secrets = ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
}

workflow "On issue comments" {
  on = "issue_comment"
  resolves = ["probot/stale-action@master - issue_comment"]
}

action "probot/stale-action@master - issue_comment" {
  uses = "probot/stale-action@master"
  secrets = ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
}

workflow "On pull request" {
  on = "pull_request"
  resolves = ["probot/stale-action@master - PR"]
}

action "probot/stale-action@master - PR" {
  uses = "probot/stale-action@master"
  secrets = ["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
}
```
